Tired of climbing ladders and stairs?  
With this Mod you teleport instant to the end, never waste time!  
But did you know that teleporting makes you hungry?  
  
Rightclick with emoty hands to the first or last ladder/ stair.  
  
The Player must have atleast 5 Foodlevels (2.5 bars)  
  
For every 10 blocks teleport, it consume 1 foodlevel (0.5 bar) with a limit of 15 foodleves (7.5 bars).
